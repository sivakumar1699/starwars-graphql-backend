Full-Stack Star Wars Character Explorer with GraphQL, React, and Neo4j

This project is a full-stack web application that demonstrates how to build and integrate a GraphQL backend with a React frontend. The backend is powered by Apollo Server and Neo4j, 
providing a GraphQL API for managing Star Wars character data, including queries and mutations for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting characters. The frontend is built with 
React and Apollo Client, featuring a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore character lists, view details, and perform CRUD operations through GraphQL queries and mutations. 
This project highlights modern full-stack development with schema-driven APIs, state management via Apollo Client, and graph database integration.
